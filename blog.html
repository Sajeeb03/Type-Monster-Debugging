                            <strong>Here is the discussion about local storage and session storage</strong> <br>
                            <p>
                                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will
                                support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of
                                persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser
                                session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads
                                (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).</p>

                                <p>Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to
                                    sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing
                                    existence of data in either case.</p>

                                <p> localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between
                                    pages
                                    (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read
                                    or
                                    changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related
                                    data
                                    within applications.

                                Local Scope occurs when you create a variable inside a function. By doing that, the visibility and
                                accessibility of the variable is only allowed within that function. Any variable created inside the
                                yellow box is a local variable, just like any variable inside blue box is a global one
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default.
                                This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized
                                scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.

                            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin
                            adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
                            appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom
                            CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                            <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
