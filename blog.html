                            <strong>Here is the discussion about local storage and session storage</strong> <br>
                            <p>
                                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will
                                support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of
                                persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser
                                session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads
                                (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).</p>

                                <p>Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to
                                    sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing
                                    existence of data in either case.</p>

                                <p> localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between
                                    pages
                                    (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read
                                    or
                                    changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related
                                    data
                                    within applications.

                                Block Level Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the
                                outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the
                                variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it.

                                The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default.
                                This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized
                                scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.

                            <strong>Here is how event loop works.</strong>
                            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
                                Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
                                Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
